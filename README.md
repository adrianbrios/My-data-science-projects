# My_data_science_projects
Repository in construction where you will find the notebooks with some data science projects I've worked on. 
For now it contains:
- **Identifying Age-Related Conditions:** A notebook built as part of a kaggle competition to predict, given some measurements of health characteristics, if a person has any of three medical conditions.
- **Titanic_competition**: The famous titanic competition on kaggle to classify if a certain passenger survived or not.
